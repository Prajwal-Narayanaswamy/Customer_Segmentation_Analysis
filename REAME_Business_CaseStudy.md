# Customer_Segmentation_Analysis
Sun Food Shop is an established local grocery store in the suburbs of Miami, Florida. A previous marketing analysis revealed that more families with young children are moving into the area. Having a baby is known to be a major life event which changes the buying behavior of parents. Sun food Shop is considering increasing marketing spend on parents with babies and want to understand if their current customers have high average purchase when compared to other customer categories. Additionally they want to understand their market share of parents with babies compared to the percent of this population in the surrounding area (3.4% of total population). Finally, Sun Food Shop has asked you to identify other potentially lucrative customer segments that purchase more than the average customer.
